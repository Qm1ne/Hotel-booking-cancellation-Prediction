Second choice: Hotel Reservations Dataset
1. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsan81/hotel-reservations-classification-dataset)

2. The online hotel reservation channels have dramatically changed booking possibilities and customersâ€™ behavior. A significant number of hotel reservations are called-off due to cancellations or no-shows. The typical reasons for cancellations include change of plans, scheduling conflicts, etc. This is often made easier by the option to do so free of charge or preferably at a low cost which is beneficial to hotel guests but it is a less desirable and possibly revenue-diminishing factor for hotels to deal with.

3. Cancelation is the target

4. An event

5. classification 

6. 18

7. 36272

8. I can notice the data isn't much balanced so that may require splits.
